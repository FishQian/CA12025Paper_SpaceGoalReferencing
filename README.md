# Mechanisms of experience-dependent place-cell referencing in hippocampal CA1
Repository Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive MATLAB codebase for analyzing source datasets and generating publication-quality figures. The implementation is designed to be self-contained to fully reproduce all graphical elements from our current publications, along with supplemental analyses developed during the research process (including rebuttal materials and supplementary exploratory results).

Data Availability Notice

The source datasets remain temporarily restricted as we actively pursue additional investigations for a companion publication. Public release of the raw data is anticipated in 2026, subject to research progress. Updates will be provided through standard academic channels.

Licensing & Usage

This code is provided without formal licensing restrictions. While no usage limitations are imposed, we require ethical application consistent with academic integrity standards. Users are expressly prohibited from malicious exploitation.
