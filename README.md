# Mechanisms of experience-dependent place-cell referencing in hippocampal CA1
## Repository Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive MATLAB codebase for analyzing the imaging and whole-cell datasets and generating publication-quality figures for the paper. The implementation is designed to be self-contained to fully reproduce all graphical elements from our current publications, along with supplemental analyses developed during the research process (including rebuttal materials and supplementary exploratory results). 

## Data Availability Notice
### Imaging source datasets
The imaging source datasets remain temporarily restricted as we actively pursue additional investigations for a companion publication. Public release of the raw data is anticipated in 2026, subject to research progress. Links will be provided once we have updates.

### Whole-cell source datasets.
The whole-cell source datasets remain temporarily restricted. If open-sourced in the future, a link will also be provided.
